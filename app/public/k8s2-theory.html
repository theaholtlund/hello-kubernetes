        <h2 class="heading">Best Practices for Deployments</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          When deploying applications in Kubernetes, it is essential to follow
          best practices to ensure efficiency, reliability and scalability. Here
          are some tips:
        </p>
        <ul class="best-practices-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Use declarative configuration:</strong> Define the desired
            state for the application using YAML manifests to ensure consistency
            and reproducibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Implement resource limits:</strong> Set resource limits and
            requests to prevent resource contention and ensure fair allocation
            of resources among pods.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Monitor and auto-scale:</strong> Utilise Kubernetes'
            built-in monitoring tools and pod level autoscaling to dynamically
            adjust resources based on workload demands.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Implement health checks:</strong> Define readiness and
            liveness probes to ensure that pods are healthy and ready to serve
            traffic.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Manage secrets securely:</strong> Use Kubernetes secrets to
            store sensitive information such as API keys, passwords and
            certificates securely.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="heading">Popular Tools for Deployments</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          There are various tools and frameworks available to streamline
          Kubernetes deployments and management. Some popular ones include:
        </p>
        <ul class="tools-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Helm:</strong> A package manager for Kubernetes that
            simplifies the deployment and management of applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Kustomize:</strong> A tool for customising Kubernetes
            resource configurations without modifying the original YAML files.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Argo CD:</strong> A GitOps continuous delivery tool for
            Kubernetes that automates the deployment of applications based on
            Git repository changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prometheus:</strong> An open-source monitoring and alerting
            toolkit designed for Kubernetes and cloud-native applications.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flux:</strong> A GitOps operator for Kubernetes that ensures
            the cluster state matches the desired state defined in Git
            repositories.

        />
        <h1 class="heading">Kubernetes Deployment Strategies</h1>
        <p>
          Kubernetes offers several deployment strategies to ensure smooth
          updates and minimal downtime. These strategies help in managing the
          lifecycle of applications effectively.
        </p>
        <h2 class="subheading">Rolling Updates</h2>
        <p>
          Rolling updates allow a user to update the application gradually.
          Kubernetes progressively replaces instances of the old version of the
          application with the new version.
        </p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Blue-Green Deployment</h2>
        <p>
          In a blue-green deployment, the user creates two separate environments
          - one for the current version (blue) and one for the new version
          (green). Once the green environment is ready, traffic is switched from
          blue to green.
        </p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Canary Releases</h2>
        <p>
          Canary releases involve rolling out the update to a small subset of
          users before rolling it out to the entire user base. This allows for
          testing the update in a production environment with minimal risk.
        </p>

        <h2 class="subheading">A/B Testing</h2>
        <p>
          A/B testing involves deploying two versions (A and B) simultaneously
          to compare their performance. Traffic is split between the two
          versions, and metrics are collected to determine the better-performing
          version.
        </p>

        <h2 class="subheading">Shadow Testing</h2>
        <p>
          Shadow testing runs the new version alongside the current version,
          without sending traffic to the new version. It is used to test how the
          new version performs with real production data.
