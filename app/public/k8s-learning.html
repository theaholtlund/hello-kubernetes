      <h2 class="heading">Best Practices for Kubernetes Deployments</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        When deploying applications in Kubernetes, it's essential to follow best
        practices to ensure efficiency, reliability, and scalability. Here are
        some tips:
      </p>
      <ul class="paragraph">
        <li>
          Use declarative configuration: Define your application's desired state
          using YAML manifests to ensure consistency and reproducibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implement resource limits: Set resource limits and requests to prevent
          resource contention and ensure fair allocation of resources among
          pods.
        </li>
        <li>
          Monitor and auto-scale: Utilize Kubernetes' built-in monitoring tools
          and horizontal pod autoscaling to dynamically adjust resources based
          on workload demands.
        </li>
        <li>
          Implement health checks: Define readiness and liveness probes to
          ensure that pods are healthy and ready to serve traffic.
        </li>
        <li>
          Manage secrets securely: Use Kubernetes secrets to store sensitive
          information such as API keys, passwords, and certificates securely.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Popular tools section -->
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="heading">Popular Tools for Kubernetes Deployments</h2>
      <p class="paragraph">
        There are various tools and frameworks available to streamline
        Kubernetes deployments and management. Some popular ones include:
      </p>
      <ul class="paragraph">
        <li>
          <strong>Helm:</strong> A package manager for Kubernetes that
          simplifies the deployment and management of applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Kustomize:</strong> A tool for customizing Kubernetes resource
          configurations without modifying the original YAML files.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Argo CD:</strong> A GitOps continuous delivery tool for
          Kubernetes that automates the deployment of applications based on Git
          repository changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Prometheus:</strong> An open-source monitoring and alerting
          toolkit designed for Kubernetes and cloud-native applications.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flux:</strong> A GitOps operator for Kubernetes that ensures
          the cluster's state matches the desired state defined in Git
          repositories.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Deployment strategies section -->
    <div class="container">
      <h1 class="heading">Kubernetes Deployment Strategies</h1>
      <p>
        Kubernetes offers several deployment strategies to ensure smooth updates
        and minimal downtime. These strategies help in managing the lifecycle of
        applications effectively.
      </p>
      <h2 class="heading">Rolling Updates</h2>
      <p>
        Rolling updates allow a user to update the application gradually.
        Kubernetes progressively replaces instances of the old version of the
        application with the new version.
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading">Blue-Green Deployment</h2>
      <p>
        In a blue-green deployment, the user create two separate environments -
        one for the current version (blue) and one for the new version (green).
        Once the green environment is ready, traffic is switched from blue to
        green.
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading">Canary Releases</h2>
      <p>
        Canary releases involve rolling out the update to a small subset of
        users before rolling it out to the entire user base. This allows for
        testing the update in a production environment with minimal risk.
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading">A/B Testing</h2>
      <p>
        A/B testing involves deploying two versions (A and B) simultaneously to
        compare their performance. Traffic is split between the two versions,
        and metrics are collected to determine the better-performing version.
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading">Shadow Testing</h2>
      <p>
        Shadow testing runs the new version alongside the current version,
        without sending traffic to the new version. It is used to test how the
        new version performs with real production data.
